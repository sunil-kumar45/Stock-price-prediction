# Stock-price-prediction
The primary objective of this project is to develop and compare different deep learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and CNN, to forecast future values in a time series dataset. The goal is to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and identify the most effective model architecture for accurate predictions.
## Background: 
Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains such as finance, weather prediction, and stock market analysis. Traditional statistical methods often struggle with complex patterns in time series data. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to capture these patterns and improve forecasting accuracy.

## Data Collection: 
Collect historical time series data relevant to the forecasting task.
## Preprocessing: 
Normalize the data using MinMaxScaler, and split it into training, validation, and test sets.
## Model Development:
LSTM Model: Build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture long-term dependencies in the time series data.<br />
GRU Model: Develop a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model as a more computationally efficient alternative to LSTM.<br />
CNN Model: Implement a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect local patterns in the time series data.<br />
Hybrid Model: Combine LSTM and GRU layers to leverage the strengths of both architectures.<br />
Model Training and Evaluation:<br />

Train each model using the training dataset and evaluate their performance on the validation set.<br />
Use RMSE as the primary metric for model comparison.<br />
Fine-tune the models by adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of layers, units, dropout rates, and learning rates.<br />
Results Analysis:<br />

Compare the RMSE of the LSTM, GRU, CNN, and hybrid models.<br />
Visualize the predicted vs. actual values to assess the models' performance.<br />
Analyze the trade-offs between model complexity and accuracy.<br />

Programming Language: Python<br />
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib<br />
## Challenges:

Handling overfitting in complex models like LSTM and GRU.<br />
Optimizing hyperparameters to achieve the lowest possible RMSE.<br />
Ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.<br />
## Future Work:<br />

Experiment with more advanced architectures like Transformer models.<br />
Explore ensemble methods by combining the predictions of multiple models.<br />
Extend the project to include multivariate time series forecasting.<br />
This project will provide a deep dive into the capabilities of neural networks for time series forecasting and highlight the importance of model selection and tuning in achieving high forecasting accuracy.<br />
