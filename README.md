# Stock-price-prediction
The primary objective of this project is to develop and compare different deep learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and CNN, to forecast future values in a time series dataset. The goal is to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and identify the most effective model architecture for accurate predictions.
